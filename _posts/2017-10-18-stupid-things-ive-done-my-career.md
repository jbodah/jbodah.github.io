## Dropped the `users` table on production

While I don't actually think on-the-job mistakes like this are stupid, I think
it's important to recognize that we all make blunders in our day-to-day. When I
read about things like the [Gitlab one](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5rd79m/gitlab_employee_just_ran_rm_rf_on_their/)
earlier this year I'm humbled and reminded that these come with the job and with learning.

My worst case was dropping the `users` table when I thought I was connected to the
staging database - woops! I've also seen all of the company's secrets compromised
and hundreds of records deleted due to an unintentional unique index. The moral of the
story is that these things happen and they are why having automation (in this case backups and
key rotation) is so important.

## Held-in negative feelings about a team/team member

My first team out of school had some issues. We didn't communicate enough and had
trouble structuring our work. We were friendly enough to each other but we didn't
really talk - work-related or not - with the exception of a few meetings throughout
the week. Things felt inefficient and degenerate. People were walking out of retros
before they were done, lots of important work was being done untracked, and nobody
had a good idea of how the project was going.

I had read about agile, pairing, things like Kanban boards in school but I felt too
junior to bring it up. Instead I tried to convince others through example. I made
my own Kanban board for my work and displayed it outside my desk. It got some comments
but never caught on with the team as a whole.

Eventualy I cracked. I was working until midnight some nights trying to finish the
project which didn't help matters. When I put in my resignation I blew up in my
exit interview and laid down all of the issues I saw but in retrospect it was all
too late. I still remember talking to one of my superiors about how it didn't feel
like our team got along and I remember him replying along the lines of "and you want
me to change that?". The meat of the problem was that I saw issues with how the team
was functioning and instead of contributing to recognize and solve these problems I
let them fester until I was too fed up. I let my anxieties and nervousness get the
best of me because I was too afraid to be wrong or get my ideas criticized.

These days things are much different. If there are personal problems on the team, I
work with my manager to try and get suggestions and feedback for resolving the
problem. If there are process problems on the team, I'm open and objective. I've
found it's important to separate work-life from real-life by being candid about
issues at work while not letting it cloud your personal judgement about people.

## Didn't talk with co-workers in other departments

You know what's weird? Working in the same small company as someone for two years
and never talking to them. I've never been a social butterfly but you run into
people all the time; in the kitchen, walking to work, at all-hands meetings. All
it takes is a simple "Hey, how's it going? How was your weekend?" to brighten up
a workplace.

This is something that folks at my current company are extremely good at, and I
can't tell you how important it is for company culture. Just a little extra effort
in making small talk with the folks in your company when you run into them really
does make the whole place feel a lot more enjoyable to work at.

## Took a .NET job

I had two years of Rails experience when I was hunting for my first real job and
I (foolishly) thought that all web development was more-or-less the same. I mean -
it's all just HTTP at some level, right? Well, that couldn't be further from the
truth.

Pretty much everything about working in .NET was different. Of course C# is
compiled and Ruby is interpreted, but I found things like switching from Rack-based
servers to IIS extremely difficult, and I was shocked when I wanted to `tail` the
logs and no-one knew how! Reliance on Visual Studio was high and trying to run the
build outside of that was a sure way to get burned. While not specific to .NET, the
company was using a single SVN repository where 200+ developers just merged to trunk
instead of using Git and pull requests. I found adapting from MVC to MVVM to be a
challenge, and it was even more challenging trying to explain the difference to my
co-workers.

When I found myself one day using Cygwin, running Cucumber tests, writing Ruby
scripts for my dev environment, and relying on Sublime instead of Visual Studio
it seemed pretty clear to me that I had made a mistake and wasn't in the right
place. It was nice to learn that I don't like working in Windows, but it was also
an expensive mistake that I wasn't totally aware I was making at the time.
