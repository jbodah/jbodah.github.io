Hey, I'm Josh.
I've been working as a professional dev since 2011.
I spend most of my day working with Elixir, Ruby, and Javascript.
I also ocassionally dip into UNIX, Kubernetes, Docker, and MySQL among other things.

Feel free to checkout some of my open source projects and contributions on [my github](https://github.com/jbodah)
